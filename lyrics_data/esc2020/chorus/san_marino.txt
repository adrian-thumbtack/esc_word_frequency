Drinks on rooftops and kiss in the dark
Dance around late at night in the park
Sparkle it up, dressing in colours
'Cause life is good when we're freaky, freaky, freaky

Yeah, we wanna break all the rules
And make up some new
Then we'll destroy all of them too
'Cause that's what we do, oh yeah
And life goes by too quickly now not to be freaking it up
Freaking it up
Freaky, freaky, freaky
