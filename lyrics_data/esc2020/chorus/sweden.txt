Even when the rain is falling
Even when you hit the bottom
I'll be there
I'll be there

'Cause there ain't no ocean
Deeper than my love for you
And there ain't no fire
That I wouldn't run right through
There ain't no mountain
Baby, that I wouldn't move
Nothing that I wouldn't do for you
'Cause you do it for me too

Oh oh, oh, oh oh
Oh oh, oh, oh oh
Oh oh, oh, oh oh
Oh
'Cause you do it for me too
Oh oh, oh, oh oh
