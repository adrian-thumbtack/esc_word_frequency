Na-na-nothing can stop me, no-nobody can hold me down
Standing in the light, it's a new world, let me be your supergirl
Na-na-nothing can stop me, no-nobody can hold us down
Fighting in the dark over true love, let me be your supergirl

I'm your supergirl
Fighting from the heart
I'm your supergirl, supergirl, oh na na
In this crazy world, crazy world, oh na na
I'm your supergirl, supergirl, oh na na
Fighting from the heart, from the heart, oh na na
