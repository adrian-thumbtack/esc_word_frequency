(Kay ma, kay ma) Kemama, you know
They can say what they want, you should let it go
'Cause tonight I will show love
I'll show them I can dance on my own

I'mma put my heart on the stove
Let y'all feel the heat
You'll be playing with the fire
If you dance with me
I wasn't always like that
I wasn't born like that
I just work like that
Twenty-four, seven
