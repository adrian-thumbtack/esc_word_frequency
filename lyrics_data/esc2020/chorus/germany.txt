Oh, don't tell your mama what you're doing tonight
Twenty-four hours ago you got that look in your eyes
Don't need your number, 'cause I know you be there
Happen all night and the beat don't lie, we're crystal clear
'Cause if I got you with me tonight
Feeling like I'm feeling tonight
Don't tell your mama
Oh, you're such a violent thing
Oh...
