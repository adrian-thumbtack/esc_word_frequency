We were young and naive
Didn’t know what we need
We were in such a rush to grow up
We were restless, confused
Summer nights on the roof
Didn't know what was in front of us

Chasing the high life
Stuck in the low lights
But we never know what we have
Until it's over and we’re looking back
Speeding through red lights
We had a good ride
But we never know what we have
Until it's over and we're looking back
