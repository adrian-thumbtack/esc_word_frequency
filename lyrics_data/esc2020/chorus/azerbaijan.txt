There was no intervention
I was lost, falling out with myself
I was so filled with tension
Getting mad was my cry for help
Now I'm back with a vengeance
I've found my inner voice again
And it speaks to my soul loud and clear
And it sounds like this…

Nam Myōhō Renge Kyō
Nam Myōhō Renge Kyō
Nam Myōhō Renge Kyō
Like Cleopatra
La la la la, la la la la
La la la la la la, like Cleopatra
La la la la, la la la la
La la la la la la, like Cleopatra
