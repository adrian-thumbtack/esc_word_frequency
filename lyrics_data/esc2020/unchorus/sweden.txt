We try, we fight
We fall, it's alright
That's life
Oh, life
We wipe those eyes

Oh oh, life

When highs turn low
I'll guide you home
That's right
Damn right

Everybody wanna move like us
Everybody wanna move like us
Everybody wanna move like us
We're moving mountains
Everybody wanna move like us
Everybody wanna move like us
Everybody wanna move like us
We're moving mountains
Oh
