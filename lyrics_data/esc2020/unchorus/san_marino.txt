So, when you touch me, I feel your love all over my body (Body, body, body, body)
You make me feel like I'm spinning from the way that you want me (Want me, want me, want me, want me, want me, want)

Put on a show, cuckoo completely
Some people think our love is freaky, freaky, freaky
They say we're cray, I must be faking
But you and I, we like it freaky, freaky, freaky

So, when you touch me, I feel your love all over my body (Body, body, body, body)
You make me feel like I'm spinning from the way that you want me (Want me, want me, want me)

Freaky, freaky, freaky
Freaky, freaky, freaky

They say we cray, I must be faking
But you and I, we like it freaky, freaky, freaky
Sparkle it up, dressing in colours
'Cause life is good when we're freaky, freaky, freaky
