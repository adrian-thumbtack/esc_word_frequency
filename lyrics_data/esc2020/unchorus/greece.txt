Keep the phone booth, don't need a super car
No X-ray vision to show them who we are
I got the power, climb up the tower
Save all humanity on zero hour

There's no wonder it takes a woman
To be a hero more than a human
To overflow your heart with electricity
Find through the shadows your true identity

Fly, give me a signal and I'll fly
On a supersonic high
Like a hero in the sky
I will stand by your side
