How do you want me to talk like an Englishman?
Where do you want me to dress like an Italian?
Now do you want me to dance like a Spanish guy?
I guess you don't love me
No, you don't love me
How do you want me to dance like an Englishman?
Where do you want me to dress like an Italian?
Now do you want me to dance like a Spanish guy?
I guess you don't love me
No, you don't love me

So tell me why do you want me to smell like a French homme?
Oh, tell me why do you want me to play like a German?
Why don't you want me to be just the way I am?
I guess you don't love me
Why don't you love me?
