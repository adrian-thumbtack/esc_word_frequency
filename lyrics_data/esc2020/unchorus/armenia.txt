I got it
You wanna take me to the party
'Cause you're naughty, huh
Well, let me tell you one kind of story

Yeah, I start it, I make it, I ride it, I work it
Don't like it, I'm gonna say no
I ain't lyin', I'm tryin', I'm flyin', no buyin'
And I know I'm gonna make it to the top

Keepin' my diamonds on you
I'm keepin' my diamonds on you
Keepin' my diamonds on you
"I got angels by my side"
And this is what I say to you
Diamonds shinin' on me
My diamonds shinin' on me
Diamonds shinin' on me
You said "I don't really care"
Can't you see I'm right here?

Boy, don't deny, my lips on fire, they're screamin'
Boy, let me breathe, you're all I need and I say
Boy, call my name, we're burnin' flame, I want you
Boy, I am yours, only yours and of course hurt me

I'm starin' at you while sittin' next to you
I think I got a juice, I started thinkin' how my name would sound to you
So you were walkin' towards me and I knew I should believe
I would be the one that'll really make you feel like a boss

I got it
You wanna take me to the party
'Cause you're naughty, huh
Well, let me tell you one kind of story
