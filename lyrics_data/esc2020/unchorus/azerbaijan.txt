Cleopatra was a queen like me
Just like me, yeah, just like me
Straight or gay or in between
In between, yeah, in between
Betrayed by a lover
So hard to recover
Couldn't see the forest for the trees
Just like me, oh, in too deep

Cleopatra had Mark Antony
You know who I mean, not the Latin king
The one from Rome who lived long ago
After Caesar died, Cleo's gigolo
Part Goddess, part temptress
The way he left me, it was shameless
She was her own worst enemy
Just like me, yeah, just like me

Sound-sounds like this
I can feel her spirit run through me
I can see it in my mind like a movie
Egyptian and Latin, the voices run through me
Come to me
