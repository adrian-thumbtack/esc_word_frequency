Shackled bones, around all these thrones come screaming
Behind a wall of egos, there is a hidden hero in us, in us
In all of us

You make me feel like, oh-oh-oh
You make me feel like, oh-oh-oh
You make me, you make me feel like, oh-oh-oh
You make me feel like

Sticks and stones, oh-oh
Might break all I own
Come beatin', beatin', beatin'
Behind a wall of egos, there is a hidden hero in us, oh-oh-oh

I give you fire shots
Shackle bolts hidden around
Everybody sing, come on
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
