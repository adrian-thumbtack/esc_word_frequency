Got that thing that I can't deny
Killing me soft with the big brown eyes
Such a violent thing, would you let me know
Knocking me down like a domino, oh

You know that I'm right here, I'm working on love
I'm waiting on something I need
I think that you, you know
You know what I want
You got me on the edge of my seat

Shooting high, we're getting low
Guns and roses all alone
And I wanna hear what you gotta say
But you won't give me no audio, oh
