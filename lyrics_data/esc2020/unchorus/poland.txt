Ashes to ashes, dust into dust
I'll follow you through black
Try to forgive that I'm not awake
I'm dreaming this dream could last

Like moths to a flame
Like bird to a pane of glass
Hoping for change but we do the same
We're gasoline and a match

We just want it all
Used to be a tower so tall
Now we only are crumbling walls
We rise and fall
Moth to the flame, as we do the same
Like a bird to a pane of glass

Down to the wire
Empires fall
