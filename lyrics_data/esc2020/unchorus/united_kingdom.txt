Some people let go
Some people let love slip away, yeah
But I'm gonna hold on
When no one believes, I'll keep the faith

We all need a lifeline
Someone to call when we're alone, hmm, yeah
It's all good in the good times
But I'll still be there when it all goes wrong
Yes, I will

And I know that we're in trouble
But I swear that we'll survive
