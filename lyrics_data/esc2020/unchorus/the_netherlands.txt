When I'm sad, I am unreasonable
Just like a little kid, mad at the world
When I'm alone, I am defenseless
Just like the boy I was, afraid in the dark

Wide awake, the planet spins around
A little too fast for me most of the time
Lost control, my thoughts are flickering
Just like satellites, lost in the sky

One day I'll find
Some peace of mind
And then I'll stop being afraid
I won't make it through the night

The more I learn, the less I know
Through every high and every low
Oh, oh, the more I learn (Grow)
The less I know (Grow)
Through every high and every low (Grow)
I'll grow, oh-oh
The more I learn (Grow)
The less I know (Grow)
Through every high and every low (Grow)
I'll grow, oh-oh
