I find myself longing for attention
I'm not myself doing what I do
I know I may have hurt someone I love along the way
It wasn't my intention
I lost myself doing what I do

I fool myself just to make you happy
And when I do, it's all the same to you (It's all the same to you)

Oh, I don't wanna do this no more
If I'm the only one here on the dance floor, on the dance floor
Oh
