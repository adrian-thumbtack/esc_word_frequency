I don't wanna feel you
I don't wanna feel you this close
I don't wanna hold you
Do I wanna hold or let go
I don't wanna fight the night
Inside with you

I am surrounded by walls
Covered with all your memories
Wish this this were solitary, no
Walking with me in the halls
So, there is no forgetting
I know you'll never let me

I don't wanna need you
I don't wanna seem so desperate
I don't wanna tell you
I don't wanna hear it's useless
I don't wanna fight the night
Inside with you
