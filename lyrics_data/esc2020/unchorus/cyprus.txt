I don't feel like talking, let me sit here alone
The phone's calling, I can't pick it up

Drowning out my memories, from the night before
Door's knocking, just leave me alone

Looking, losing
My energy, tripping
Anybody tow me back home
Yeah, yeah
Standing naked
Putting on fake smiles
I don't wanna be sad anymore
Anymore, anymore, anymore, anymore, yeah, yeah, yeah
I don't wanna fall again
