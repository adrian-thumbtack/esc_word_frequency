The sun is rising ink
For me it's hard to blink
I'm falling
I wrote some stupid words
Before I lost my mind
And called you
A taste of bittersweet
To chase the memories
Blue heaven
I need you but it hurts
To feel like I deserve
Your weapons

If you're the enemy
Then maybe I'm too weak to see it
The fire's in my chest
But I won't let my head believe it
If this is just a dream
Don't wake me in between
I mean it
You lied so many times
But right between the lines
I read it
