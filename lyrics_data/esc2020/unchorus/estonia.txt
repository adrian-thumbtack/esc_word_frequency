How mysterious this life can be
Full of beautiful surprises
I never really knew the man I thought was me
Dreams that I believed
Convinced my destiny
I was meant to be alone

But how can you know how a star looks
If you've never looked at the sky?
I couldn't have told you what blue is
Till I looked into your eyes
Or how soft the feel of a cloud is
Till I was touching your skin
The world is a wonder of wonders I'd never seen

Much too sensible, too reasonable
Ever to believe in miracles
But now you've come to me
Changed my destiny
I'll never be alone
