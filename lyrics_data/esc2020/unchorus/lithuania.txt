I'm a human, not a stone
I can make a change and go
Wherever I want to
They told me maybe I'm too old
But there's fire in my soul

There's no doubt I'm strong enough
To reach the state I've dreamed of
It's gonna happen
And I will do what I can
Just to be a better man

Can't believe it took so long
To take an action and move on
No one can stop me
Through the clouds, there comes the sun
And I'm ready for some fun
Uh

La la la la la, la la la la la
La la la la la, la la la la la la
La la la la la, la la la la la
La la la la la

Come on, let's ride
(Ooh)
