I will keep on going, I will keep on running
Run until I reach the end
Strong enough to take it
I am gonna make it
Destiny is in my hands

Thought I'll never get up, thought I'm gonna give up
Lost on my way, many times betrayed
But still breathing, I'm still breathing
Nothing to regret, never looking back

Every day I wake up, trying to get higher
Be a better woman, working even harder
I’m still breathing, I’m still breathing
Listening to my heart, ready for the start

Reaching for the stars, I know I’m getting closer
Life is music, I am a composer
My dreams become so real with all the love I’m feeling
I’m still breathing, I’m still breathing
