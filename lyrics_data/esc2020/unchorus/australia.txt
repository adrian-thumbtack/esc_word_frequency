I don't feel the same buzz
When your name comes up on my phone anymore
Feels like I don't feel you
I fear you
And it makes me cry on my floor

It feels like you're taking me for granted
I've given you everything I have, yeah
And I can barely bring to mind
The reason why I've stretched myself so far for
You

Isn't love a compromise
Two people trying to keep the fire burning
You've been busy playing round and starting fights
While I've been busy earning
Every time that I try to explain it
You think that your pain is more important
And the hardest thing is that I don't wanna give you up
I love you, I love you, I love you

I lie awake while you're asleep
I listen to the sound
Of all the words I couldn't say 'til now
