Never had the heart to pray
I never thought I'd find the way
But now I do
Now I do
Always felt I was no good
Always felt misunderstood
But now I don't
Now I don't

'Cause your great love is healing me
Renewing me through and through
I am free to live, so I give you

Now I know your words are true
My heart is filled with gratitude
It's only you, I'm living for
Your amazing love, so sweet
Has raised me to my feet
I ain't going back anymore

Now I sing about you, dream about you
All the time
Don't wanna live without you, so I give you

Now I sing about you, dream about you
All the time (All of the time)
Don't wanna live without you, oh, no
Don't wanna live without you
Now I sing about you, dream about you
All the time
Don't wanna live without you, yeah
