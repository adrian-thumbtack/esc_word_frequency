Everybody told me that I'd never be someone
I'm not a puppet on a string, no, no I'm not
And everybody said that I was always breaking rules
Why would I ever wanna put myself inside a box?

They said if I was blonde that I could make it, so I did it
Then they said, "You're almost perfect, but you talk too much", ha
Try and dumb it down a little, make sure that you're in the middle
Rock it all you want, but make it pop enough

My life, yeah, I'm gonna be me, yeah
I'm gonna believe it's right
My life, yeah, I gotta be me
I gotta believe it's right

My life, yeah, I'm gonna be me, yeah
I'm gonna believe it's right
My life, yeah, I gotta be me
I gotta believe it's right
