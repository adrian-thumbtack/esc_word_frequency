Words have cut me to the bone
And my heart is sinking like a stone
But I don't let it show
Barely take another breath
Though I'm suffocating here alone
I'll never let you know

You have made me doubt my faith
Hide the truth behind another lie
But you won't see me cry
I pray for you for all you've done
All the hurt that you leave in your wake
It's so hard not to break

You think I'm better without a way to speak my mind
You think I don't wanna shout and that I'm terrified
Screaming inside
With nowhere to hide
You won't let me fly
