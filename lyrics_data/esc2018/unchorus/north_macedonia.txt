Come and take me, I can show you how it's done
Come and take me when no one is around
Come and take me, I can show you how it's done
We'll be lost and we'll be

If you want me, I can tell you what it's all about
You're standing in the shadow, I'm wondering why
You're in the dark
I want a deeper, deeper love
I want you by my side
Just let me deeper, go deeper

I wish you trust your intitution and let the journey start
You're afraid that you might suffer
But trust me what you'll find will blow your mind
I want a deeper, deeper love
I want you by my side
Just let me deeper, go deeper, go deeper

We'll be lost and we'll be
