Curtains down, I’m laughing at the trial
Help me to unravel
Tangle of my innocence inside
Faith’s bout to be severed

Desperate thoughts, your hope calls you a liar
Fear begins to revel
Nothing but your will sets you on fire
Fire lasts forever

You can see that whatever the weather
That the wind’s always there, always fair, oh oh oh
And it has always been now or never
The decision has got to be made
