It's a fine, fine line
Between whiskey, and water, into wine
It's a long way home
When you're down and out and out here on your own
But it don't matter who you are when it's time to lock and load

When they knock you to the ground
You ain't gonna let nobody keep you down
When your back's against the wall
That's when you gotta learn to stand up tall
Yeah, that rebel fight inside of you
Has been there all along

I said, everybody's got a little outlaw in 'em, aw
