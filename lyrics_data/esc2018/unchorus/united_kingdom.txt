Hey, hey brother
Do you remember when we were kids with no fear?
Hey, hey sister
Do you believe in the things we dreamt we'd discover?

Hey, hey mother
Am I making you proud or could I do better?
Hey, hey father
There's weight on my shoulders but it's not over

Spread your love, give all you got
Hold your head up, don't give up, no no
Hey, hey brother, don't give up, oh woah woah

Spread your love, give all you got
Hold your head up, don't give up, no no
Spread your love, give all you got
Hold your head up, through this storm, oh oh
