We were drifting like two icebergs out on the ocean
I was doing all I could to keep you close
There were troubles in the water
You swore it was nothing
You said that we would always stay afloat

Why have you been coming home so late in the evening?
Is there someone else that I should know about?
'Cause there's a smile on your face that I haven't seen
Since we started going out

We said "Until death do us part"
And then you chose to break my heart
Remember right back to the start
When we said we'd be together 'til we die
I'll forever wonder why
I thought we'd be together 'til we die
I'll forever wonder why
