Lord, I'm gonna get so high tonight
I'm gonna let the floodgates open wide
I'm in open water
This is what I need
And though I try to get you off my mind

(Hey)
Lord, I'm gonna bring you back tonight, girl
Oh, you're running circles round my mind
After your words have been my bible
How can I search for someone new?
When I really want you by my side

Don't make me tear my heart out
I'm shaking 'til I fall down
Don't make me tear my heart out
Don't make me tear my heart out
I'm shaking 'til I fall down
Don't make me tear my heart out
