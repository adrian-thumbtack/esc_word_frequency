Bullied from the moment we were born
We were always on our own
No one ever said we should be proud
Or embrace the fact of standing out
Forward too long, we just played along
Always putting up a show
But that was then, look at us now
All we want is for them to know

Uh listen up. listen up
It's me, Jenny B, what you get is what you see
As for Jess over here, she's a special VIP
So you better listen carefully
If they dissin' you on Twitter
Don't get sad, don't be bitter, don't give up or be a quitter
Show them you're better (yeah, hell no)
If they say so, get in the car, rev it up, and be it a star
'Cause you know who exactly who we are
Give it to 'em, Jess

They can make it silent
But in our hearts we'll never be

And then weâ€™ll be rising where we fall, oh, yeah (yeah, yeah)
In the middle of storm we're standing tall, oh, standing tall
And if they tell us why we're wrong, oh, oh, yeah
Then the love in our hearts will keep us strong, oh, oh
