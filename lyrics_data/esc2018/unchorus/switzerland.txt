Wild joker on a gold throne
Blood diamond, summer home
Wrong people with the right to know
But I can’t do anything about it
All saying that life’s hard
Don’t want it in our backyard
We should be further from the start
But I can’t do anything about it

Think the boogie man will get me
Think different is the enemy
It’s been this way for centuries
And I can’t do anything about it
Can’t wait to light the cannonball
Can’t face the mirror says it all
Sins of the father make us fall
And I can’t do anything about it

I ain’t standing alone
No, I ain’t standing alone
I ain’t the only one who don’t wanna throw stones
