Ships in the making
Bound for a distant shore
World for the taking
Men gone forever more
Boarding and setting sail
Yet, victory won't prevail

Call in, surrender
Still won't feel like defeat
Men laying down their swords
Each of their own accord

Freeze the arrow in the air
Make your mark and leave it hanging there
