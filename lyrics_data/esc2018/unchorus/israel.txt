Look at me, I'm a beautiful creature
I don't care about your modern-time preachers
Welcome boys, too much noise, I will teach ya
Pam pam pa hoo, Trump pam pa hoo
Hey, I think you forgot how to play
My teddy bear's running away
The Barbie got somethin' to say, hey, hey, hey
Hey! My "Simon says" leave me alone
I'm taking my Pikachu home
You're stupid just like your smartphone

Ani lo buba
Don't you go and play with me, boy
Ani lo buba
Don't you go and play, shake!
(Cululoo, cululoo) Wedding bells ringing
(Cululoo, cululoo) Money man bling bling
I don't care about your Stefa, baby
Pam pam pa hoo, Trump pam pa hoo

I'll take you now
With me
Now, boy
