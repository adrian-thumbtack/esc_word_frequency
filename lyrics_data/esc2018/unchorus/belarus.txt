It must be something that we call love
Wherever I go I'm coming back
And time cannot knock me off my track
This resolution is final
It must be something that we call love
It's when you're craving to say her name
And my reality seems to break apart with her arrival

It must be something that we call dream
When all you told me, I know by heart
The type of beauty I call supreme
And how it's driving me crazy

You'll always sing me something new
I will always follow
When I first saw you here I knew
That I was blind before you
