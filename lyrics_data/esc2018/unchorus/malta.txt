In the silence you'll find gold
When you feel warmth, I feel so cold
Can't get no sleep, I'm up 'til dawn
These demons have broken my goal
And I know, and I know, and I know that you see my life
In foreign eyes
And I know, and I know, and I know that you hear my cry
Tears tell no lie

I know that I am not alone
Let all our thoughts and ghosts unfold
In the darkness I've found home
But what is next is still unknown
And I know, and I know, and I know that you hear my cry
Tears tell no lie
