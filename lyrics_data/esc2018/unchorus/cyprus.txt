Take a dive into my eyes
Yeah, the eyes of a lioness
Feel the power, they ain't lying
A little look, a little touch
You know the power of silence
Yeah keep it up, keep it up

Take me in, take a breath
Ain't no hidden agenda
What you see is what you get

Oh, your love is like wild-wildfire
You got me pelican fly fly flyin'
