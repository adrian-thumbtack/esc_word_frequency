All the faces you see on your way
Have a story they could tell
Tiny traces of life’s joy and sorrow
Why can’t we treat each other well

In every single language
There’s a word for love and for blame
Different voices, cultures, and people, and places
Inside we’re all the same

We’ve only got each other now
Don’t walk away and play pretend
It might as well be you
Who’s suffering tonight

Together we could make a change
