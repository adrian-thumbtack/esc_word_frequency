My heart is in command
No longer in the dark
My castle in the sand
Is now made of stone and rock

The memory and you
The things I've been through
And everything I do
We start believing by the minute
Now that I'm in it
Now that I'm it

Those so-called broken wings
Are soaring through the sky, oh
I've flown with kings and queens
With freedom in their eyes

'Cause even in the darkness
'Cause even at the darkest night
'Cause even in the darkness
I can see a light
'Cause even in the darkness

My heart is in command
No longer in the dark
