It’s time
For me to say goodbye
It’s fine
I’ve tried a million times
To kiss
The emptiness
And make her mine

I should’ve stayed
But I already left a thousand times
I’ve won my fights
Nobody knew nothin’ about
All alone
Trapped in a void
Can’t see the light
Goodbye

Please
Don’t be afraid
I hear your cry
Don’t cry
