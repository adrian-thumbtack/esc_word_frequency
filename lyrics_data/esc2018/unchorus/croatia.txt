You make me feel
You got me deep inside this love
You make my heart go
When I saw your eyes, boy
You're just like a movie, black and white
You make me go straight out of my mind

I love you for this love knows no reason, no games
Just like Bonnie and Clyde, we walk the road together
No fear, no breaks

You light up my world
No I need no diamond or pearls, not that kind of girl
Over the moon
I'll be your queen and I'll be your fool

Ain't no running, no turning back
Now I'm caught in your web
Is it real, I keep asking myself
Sweet fantasy, I can't help, can't hide it
I'm shooting across the sky

I'm crazy for your love
Crazy, I'll go crazy, I'll go crazy
Love
