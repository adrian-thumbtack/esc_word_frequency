Love is like a black hole
Everything is dark
You just gotta let go
And feel it, feel it, feel it
We fell off the deep end
Just to get a rush
You know that it's right when
You feel it, feel it, feel it

Wanna be the fire
Even if it burns
Offer up my fibers
To feel it, feel it, feel it

Into the unknown
Into the unknown
Where no other love goes
I love, I love beyond the bones
