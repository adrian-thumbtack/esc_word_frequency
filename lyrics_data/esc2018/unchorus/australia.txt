Why do we always feel like we need to try
Why do we believe that we need to be somebody else
To feel alive
Why do we make
Why do we keep making the same mistakes
And believing that it won't make a difference if we try
To break away

Time
Don't you think it's just a waste of time
When we're always fighting over material trivial things
In this life
Yeah

I don't understand why we don't get it right
Why do we keep going round and round
At the end of the day, we've only got ourselves to blame

(We got love)
(We got love) We got love, we got love
(We got love) We got love

We got love
