I know I'll never forget
That day the first time we met
We've come a long way since then
And I would do it all again
From your very first smile
I knew that I'd walk a mile
See, it's for real when you know
You never wanna let go

No matter what comes our way
I feel like you're here to stay
You were there right from the start
And let me inside your heart
After all this time
I hate the sound of goodbye
And if you leave, I would

Right from our very first kiss
I knew it'll end up like this
I'm not afraid to grow old
If I have your hand to hold
