Oh, oh she a good girl at home
But her skirt goes up like Marilyn Monroe's
Papa likes the drama, mama hotter than lava
She rocking high heels Prada, her face like Madonna
By the way she moved, got me making a puddle
Baby, I already knew you would be nothing but a trouble
Dammit, everybody knows she never loved for real
Honey bunny up all night wannabe couple goals queen

When the beat dropped, she dropped, dropped it like it's hot
And now without a second thought she got me doing what I'm not
Then it got heavy, mom I'm feeling home already
But steady plenty motherfuckers wanna eat my spaghetti
Then she got one of my friends
She got him dripping on wood
I know it hurt so bad but it feels so good
Quit sweet talking me now baby I don't give a fuck
You should've thought about me before you fucked him at the club

You know I like it
When you lie, lie, lie
You look so good
When you lie, lie, lie
Set my camel in the mood
When you lie, lie, lie
When you lie, lie, lie
