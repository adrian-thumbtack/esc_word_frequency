You got secrets to unfold
You got stories never told
You’re holding information
Standing right in front of me
A hidden rhapsody
I walk into temptation

Well I guess it’s up to you
Do you feel the way I do
When bodytalk is magic
So is this my lucky day
Will you stay or walk away
Right now you’re stoppin’ traffic
