If you got a minute
Get down your idea
It may do wonders
Maybe disappear
Who knows? Just get it down
And nothing can go wrong
Go find your rhythm
That’s how you write a song (hello)

Enjoy the small things
With time they will get big
Gotta find your mission
A mission to pursue
You know you've got a talent
Whatever it may be
So work your magic
And sing along with me

Sing
Shoo bee doo bee dab dab (Shoo bee doo bee dab dab)
Sha ba da da hey (Sha ba da da hey)
Sing it all day long (All day long)
And that’s how you write a song
Scoo bee doo bee bap bap (Scoo bee doo bee bap bap)
Boogie boogie woogie hey (Boogie boogie woogie hey)
Sing it all day long (All day long)
See, that’s how you write a song
