Ain’t it funny, ain’t it funny
Oh, it all started as a joke
But now I’m falling, now I’m falling
The punch line is getting old

Cause I’ve been keeping to myself
For way too long, yeah

Ain’t it funny, ain’t it funny
I made you laugh every time we spoke
I locked my heart in hesitation
But somehow, you cracked the code

Can you see me, can you see me
Like a fire rising in the smoke?
Can you hear me, can you hear me
Open up with every note?

Cause I’ve been playing to myself
For way too long

So tell me what you’re looking for
I promise you, I got it all
What does it take to make you see?
I am right here

And if you ever need to cry
I’ll be the one who makes you laugh
Yeah, I’ll be your funny girl
Your funny girl
