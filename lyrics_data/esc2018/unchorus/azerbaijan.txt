I can hear you when I wake
I can see you when I dream
I can feel you when I break
As you hold me, as you beam
Every night you fill the sky with new revelations
Misty moon, I'm your loon
Let's rock the nation

If you're stuck in all the noise
Let me be your secret voice
If you think that you don't count
Let me prove you different now

I cross my heart
