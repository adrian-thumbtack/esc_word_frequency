Something tells me we can make some music
The rhythm is drivin’ me wild
And something tells me we ain’t gonna loose it
Keep pushin’ way into the night

Number one, keep rollin’
Say you’re real, I’m hopin’
Do you feel the way I do
Bring it on, it’s magic
Are you real, fantastic
Say you feel the way I do

Number two, keep turnin’
Feel the heat, we’re burnin’
I’ll do anything for you
We can be forever
Number one, together
We can make a dream come true
