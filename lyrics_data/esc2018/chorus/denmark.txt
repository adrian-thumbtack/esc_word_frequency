Freeze the arrow in the air
Make your mark and leave it hanging there
Be the first to turn around
Take the leap to land on higher ground

Raise the banner to the sky
Face the fear and hold your head up high
Oooh-oooh, oooh-oooh
Take the leap like you were bound for higher ground

Raise the banner to the sky
Face the fear and hold your head up high
Oooh-oooh, oooh-oooh
Take the leap like you were bound for higher ground
