Every now and then I'm drawn to places
Where I hear your voice or see your face, and
Every little thought will lead me right back to you

I was born from one love of two hearts
We were three kids and a loving mum
You made this place a home
A shelter from the storm
You said I had one life and a true heart
I tried my best and I came so far
But you will never know
'Cause you let me walk this road alone
