I still have faith
I still believe in chasing rainbows

Storms don't last forever, forever, remember
We can hold our hands together
Through this storm oh oh, through this storm, oh oh
Storms don't last forever, forever, remember
We can hold our hands together
Through this storm oh oh, through this storm, oh oh
