I tore down my walls
And wrecked the ceiling
Ready to bare it all, but

You’re looking at her, she’s looking at you
I’m falling apart, what can I do
To make you feel that way about me too?

And it’s getting hard, I’m not gonna lie
To keep in the dark all I’m feeling inside
When you walk in smelling like her perfume

What was I thinking?
I’m just the funny girl to you
