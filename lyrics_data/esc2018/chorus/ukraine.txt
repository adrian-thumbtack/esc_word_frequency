Oh oh oh oh, won’t get any better
Oh oh oh oh, walk under the ladder
Shout out just one reason what’s this for

You can see that whatever the weather
That the wind’s always there, always fair, oh oh oh
And it has always been now or never
The decision has got to be made, oh oh oh
(Oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh, yeah)
(Oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh, yeah)
