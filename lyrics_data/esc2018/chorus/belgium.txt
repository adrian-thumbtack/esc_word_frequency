Why don't we go against the tide?
Against all their advice
We keep running, we keep on running
It's just a matter of time

Before it all echoes, echoes and goes
Crashing against the walls
Hold my hand and keep your eyes closed
Before it all echows, echoes and falls
I suppose it's just a matter of time
