We are who we are
And who we are is who we wanna be
We don't have to listen
'Cause all that counts is you and me

And then weâ€™ll be rising where we fall, oh, oh
In the middle of storm we're standing tall, oh, standing tall
And if they tell us why we're wrong, oh, oh
Then the love in our hearts will keep us strong, oh, oh
