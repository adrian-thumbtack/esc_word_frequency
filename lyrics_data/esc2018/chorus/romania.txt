Why don’t you see the beauty that surrounds you everywhere
Why can’t you feel the joy in all the small things people share
And all the happiness, that by the way is all for free
Open your heart, receive the love and stay with me

We should all see the beauty of the precious gifts we have
‘Cause everyone deserves the power to go straight ahead
Never give up, don’t hit the floor, don’t trust in all the lies
No matter what the odds will bring you, please don’t say goodbye
