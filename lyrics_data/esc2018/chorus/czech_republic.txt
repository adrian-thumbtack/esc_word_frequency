I know you 'bop-whop-a-lu bop' on his wood bamboo
When you were still seeing me and well he didn't even knew hmm
But Goddammit, come and count to three, now sit down GGY
I'm on fire

So come and lie to me
Lie to me, oh baby, come a little closer
Lie to me
Lie to me, oh baby, lean upon my shoulder
Lie to me
Get down on my body and love me like it was always meant to be
Now you love somebody new, I always knew
So come and give it to me
