Come and take me, I can show you how it's done
Come and take me when no one is around
Come and take me, I can show you how it's done
We'll be lost and we'll be found
We'll be lost and we'll be found, found

Have you ever thought about it?
We went too far, no there's no way back
No way back
Have you ever thought about it?
We went too far, no there's no way back
No way back
