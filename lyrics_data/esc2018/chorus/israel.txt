Wonder Woman don't you ever forget
You're divine and he's about to regret
He's a baka mhm bak mhm bakbak bak mhm boy
Baka mhm bak mhm bakbak
I'm not your baka mhm bak mhm bak mhm bak mhm bak mhm

I'm not your toy, not your toy
You stupid boy, stupid boy
I'll take you down now, make you watch me
Dancing with my dolls on the motha-bucka beat
Not your toy (Cululoo, cululoo)
(Cululoo, cululoo)
