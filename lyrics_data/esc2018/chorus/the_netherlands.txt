Everybody's got a little outlaw in 'em
Chrome piece hidin' in their blacked out denim
Heartbeat beatin' to a rock 'n' roll rhythm, yeah
Everybody's got a couple scarred up knuckles
Blood on their boots and their back-off buckle
Diamondback rattle with a quick strike venom
Everybody's got a little outlaw in 'em
(Hmm)
