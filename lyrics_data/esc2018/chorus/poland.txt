I wanna feel alive
When I'm running through my life
So help me to ignite
This spark I feel inside
So help me now

Light me up, light me up my babe
Light me up, tell me where to go
Light me up, light me up my babe
Light me up and tell me where to go ohoh
Oooh oh oh, oooh oh
Tell me where to go-ohoh
Oooh oh oh, oooh

And tell me where to go

Tell me where to go
Tell me where to go ohoh
