Heaven knows we are
Made perfect we are
Tailored by the stars
Once we set our mind
We become divine
Take my hand, it's time

I cross my heart, I tear down the firewalls
I cross my heart, I'm stronger than cannonballs
I'll never stop
Luna moon me up, to the top
I'll never stop
Luna moon me up, to the top
