Feels like I'm stuck here in time
While I've been trying to forget ya (Forget ya)

Just wanna da-da-dance you off
So don't you da-da-dare wait up
'Cause I just wanna feel the mood
Girl, with anyone but you
And I might now
Yeah, I might now
Just trying to have myself a time (Have myself a time)
So I just don't care if you mind (Don't care if you mind)
'Cause I just wanna feel the mood
Girl, with anyone but you
And I might now
Yeah, I might now
