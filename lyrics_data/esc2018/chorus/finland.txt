So tonight I'm making friends
With all the creatures that are hiding there under my bed

I ain't gonna hold on to these monsters anymore
Now I'm gonna let in all the light, tear down the walls
At my worst I found my army strong
All the demons are gone
You can try and scare me now, but I ain't scared no more
I ain't scared no more
(I ain't, I ain't, I ain't scared no more)
