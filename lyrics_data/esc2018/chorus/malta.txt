Let our guards down, it's time to break the taboo
Before we all become animals, animals
Echos in my head, got to break the taboo
No, we will never be criminals, criminals
But sticks and stones won't break my soul
Gotta be your own miracle, miracle
It's in my bones, got to break the taboo
Before we all become animals, animals
