Oh, what should I do?
It's up to you, karma
Oh, I wish I knew
Give me a sign, karma
Just to remind you
I don't give up (Give up)
I won't give up, no
I'll always try

Yes, you gonna like it, yes, you gonna like it
Let me in your heart
Yes, you gonna like it, yes, you gonna like it
Let's break the rules
Yes, you gonna like it, yes, you gonna like it
I'll share what Iâ€™ve got
Yes, you gonna like it, yes, you gonna like it
Baby, repeat my moves
