'Cause I've been running with the demons now
They all see my fear
They say there's nothing, nothing here

I see your spirit in the sky
When northern lights are dancing
He lo e loi la
I hear you calling me at night
Whenever wind is blowing
He lo e loi la
I can see your spirit in the sky
When northern lights are dancing
He lo e loi la
