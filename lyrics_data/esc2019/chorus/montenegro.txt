Falling, I'm in Heaven, falling
I'm in Heaven, falling, straight into your heart
Falling, I'll catch you while you're falling
I hear your heart calling into my arms
Falling, I'm in Heaven, falling
I'm in Heaven, falling, straight into your heart
Falling, I'll catch you while you're falling
I hear your heart calling into my arms
I'm in Heaven
