And when they try to hold me down
Inside a box, I'll find my way out
I'm keeping it in motion, hmm hmm, hmm

When life brings me trouble, this I know
I never walk away, na na
Walk away, na-na
We are technicolor, watch us go
We never walk away, na na
Just stay with me now

Chameleon, chameleon, chameleon
Yeah la la la la la la
