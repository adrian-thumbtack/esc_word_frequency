Drink till I forget
Sheâ€™s on to the next
And when the ghost starts screaming
Right when they resonate
Hear my heart confess

It's been so hard to bear
So shut up about it
Shut up about it
It's just too hard to hear
So shut up about it
Shut up about it

Oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh
Shut up, shut up about it
