When you said you wanted the world
I said you couldn't too
You were walking right beside me
But I left no room for you
Calling you my enemy, but my enemyâ€™s right here
It was my mistake to try and break
That power that I feared

I see flames in your eyes
Damn, they burn so bright
Oh, you gotta know I'm with ya
Now, shine like city lights
Torches in the sky
Don't you try to hide it
