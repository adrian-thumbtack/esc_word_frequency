She let her body talk
She make the party stop
She gettin' naughty, ya
Droppin' it, droppin' it down

When she go low, when she go low
She go so low, she go so low
Oh, she know, oh
Oh, she know, she got me dirty dancin'
When she go low, when she go low
She go so low, she go so low
Oh, she know, oh
Oh, she know, she got me dirty dancin', dirty dancin'

Dirty dancin'
Dirty dancin'
