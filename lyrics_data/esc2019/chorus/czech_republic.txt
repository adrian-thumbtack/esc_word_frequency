She was my neighbour when we were thirteen
She moved back in
There's not much between us now
Do you know what I mean?

She’s only a friend of a friend of a friend of a friend
She's never home 'cause she plays in a band
I don't know if you'd understand
She's only a friend of a friend of a friend
I had a dream that she walked through the door
I can't recall her name anymore
Please believe me, I'm your man
She’s only a friend of a friend of a friend
