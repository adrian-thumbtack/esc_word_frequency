Wait for, oh, wait for
What I waited for
Wait for, oh, wait for
Oh, no, I'm done

Walking out, uh
Whatever I've built I'm gonna burn down
I'm walking out, uh
You're no more a king 'cause I was your crown

(Walking out) Walking out, (Walking out) walking out
Crying now
(Walking out) Walking out, (Walking out) walking out
Begging
(Walking out, uh)
(At last, I feel proud), I'm walking out
