All your dreams have gone away
No matter what you do
Love all colors of this life
And to yourself, be true
Don't forget my number
Call me anytime
I will always tell you life is beautiful and fine

Say na na na
On a dark deserted way, say na na na
There's a light for you that waits, it's na na na
Say na na na, say na na na
You're not alone, so stand up, na na na
Be a hero, be the rainbow, and sing na na na
Say na na na
