That's when you call me, that's when you call me
Say you're feeling lonely
Early in the morning, early in the morning
Time is moving slowly
We keep it undercover
I know you miss the taste
Heart beats like an 808
You need my love on replay

Replay, replay, replay, yeah
You need my love on replay
Replay, replay, replay, yeah
