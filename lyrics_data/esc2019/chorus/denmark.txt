Why we make it tough? The world has had enough
Don't get too political
And who are we to judge? It doesn't take too much
Only just a miracle

Love is forever
Love is forever and everyone
Love is forever
Love is forever and everyone
Just a taste of love, a taste of what
Could actually rule both me and you
A taste of love is all we got
So don't you never ever give up love
