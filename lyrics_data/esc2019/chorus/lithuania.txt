Ooh, you don't have to be afraid
You don't got to hurt away
'Cause we got a love that can't be caged
We got a love that can't be caged

Come on, come on, let your feelings out
Come on, come on, get your freedom now
Run wild
Run with the lions, ooh
Come on, come on, let your feelings out
Come on, come on, get your freedom now
Run wild
Run with the lions, ooh
