Take my hand and I'll lead you home
Can you understand?
You will never be alone

It's bigger than us
Itâ€™s bigger than you and me
It's bigger than us
It's bigger than everything we see
'Cause I can feel the universe
When I'm feeling you breathe
It's bigger than us
And it's bigger than you and me
It's bigger
