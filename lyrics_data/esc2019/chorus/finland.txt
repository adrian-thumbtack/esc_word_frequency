How can we go to sleep at night
And lay there in our beds?
When we know what's going on
With the world today

Is it in my head?
Am I the only one?
Is it in my head?
Where the war has just begun?

We look away, look away, look away, look away, hey
Look away, look away, look away, look away
Is it in my head?
Is it in my head?
Look away, look away, hey, no
