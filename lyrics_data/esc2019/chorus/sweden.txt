Is it too late for love? Hmm
Is it too late for love? I wanna know
Is it too late for love? I can't take no more
Is it?

I could be the sun that lights your dark
Maybe I would lit your world with just one spark
I could make it burn for you and me
If I could be there, I would be there
Hear me
I could be the sun that lights your dark
(Is it too late for love? Is it too late for love?)
Hear me
I could make it burn for you and me
