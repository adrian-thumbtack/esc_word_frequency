I'm bluer than the ocean
I'm golden like the rising sun and
I'm red with hot emotion, hmm hmm, hmm

The grass is always greener
When you love me deeper, darling
I can be your jungle, hmm hmm, hmm

Give me water, I'm a swimmer
Give me fire, I'm a fighter
Give me love, I'm your lover
Yeah la la la
Make me cry, I'll be a river
Take my heart, I'll be a giver
I can change like the weather
Yeah la la la
