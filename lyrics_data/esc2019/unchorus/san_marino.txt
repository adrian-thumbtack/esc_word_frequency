You look sad and lonely
Is something wrong tonight?
Why this rush to run away?
Things will be alright
Just be strong and look at me
Hear me when I say
Who cares that you're outta love?
It happens every day

If you're feeling lonely (If you're feeling lonely)
We can take it slowly (We can take it slowly)
Think I'm going crazy (Think I'm going crazy)
Yes, I'm going crazy
We can all go crazy
