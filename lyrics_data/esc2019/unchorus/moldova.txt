Hold on, even with the wind we'll make it
Be strong, keep the fire burning inside
Go on, as I breathe in you
Look into my eyes
Fly me high, right up to the sky

This time, we can try to keep our story
This crime, we can stop from breaking apart
No rhyme is a match for you
Never let me down
If I fall I'm nothing at all

When you come stand beside me
The earth is moving fast
Stay, stay, oh oh ooh, oh oh ooh ooh ooh
Stay (Stay), stay, oh oh ooh, oh oh ooh ooh
