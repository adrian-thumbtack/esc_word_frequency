All my life I've wondered why
I keep fighting all the tides
For a million reasons that I find
But I might, I might be all wrong
I’ve hit highs and I've hit lows
But somewhere down the winding road
It felt like I could lose it all
But I might, I might have been wrong

All my life I’ve tried to find
The meaning of what's left behind
They say it's life itself
But I feel it might, it might be all wrong

Wherever we may go
Whatever happens down the road
However far from home
I know we won't let go
