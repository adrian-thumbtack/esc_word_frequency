Mind's got to move, but I'm so trapped within me
Expanded all my limits too carelessly
And I'm counting on the time to get me back in line
'Cause nothing really makes sense no more
But I'm set on hold, so I needn't be bold anymore

I sense the pain, but it doesn't hurt anymore
It's even number than the ache I felt before
So I smile for a while, let the torture begin and
The pressure on my chest becomes almost routine, oh
It's not like I don't care, but there's nothing left to bare

And I'm letting it all come crashing down
Come breaking in
It's like the rain just left black blurred outlines
