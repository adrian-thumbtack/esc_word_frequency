You got a problem, 2 AM I'm in your head
Let's just be honest tonight, yeah
Only I can solve it
You're twisting, turning in your bed
Them sheets need my body tonight

You stuck on me darlin'
Like a love song on repeat
Yeah, you've got a problem, alright, yeah yeah
And I know I'm the one to blame
Because I make you scream my name
And baby, I'm all in tonight, mmm

And I know I'm the one to blame
'Cause I make you scream my name
Baby, I'm all in tonight, mmm yeah
That's when you call me, that's when you call me
