I'm in the mirror, so freaking bitter
But I’ve gotta get through
I'm gonna get through
Keep it together, be cool under pressure
'Cause she wants to break you
She wants to break you

Out of the mirror, it's getting clearer
But then out of the blue she crashes the room
Gotta remember, she is a killer
With that freaking perfume
Girl, it's too soon

I don't need, I don’t need the truth
I don’t need, I don't need the truth
