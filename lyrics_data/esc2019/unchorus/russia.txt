No, I can't stay here longer
You cannot make me cry
So, I will leave you to wonder
What will become of our lives

No, I can't stay here longer
You cannot make me cry
So, I will leave you to wonder
What will become of our lives

Not so silent and innocent
Acid rain from your fingerprints
Echoes, rivers of loneliness
Hitting the walls of my heart
