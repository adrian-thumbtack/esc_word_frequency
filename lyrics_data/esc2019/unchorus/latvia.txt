It was a lonely night
No stars were shining, there was no light
One troubled thought broke through
And colored my world so blue

I travelled through the time
It felt for me like doing a crime
My mind did crazy things
Imagination opened their wings

A river dark as coal
It took me far away from the shore
Please come to me 'till sunrise
And take me back to my paradise

Love, love
