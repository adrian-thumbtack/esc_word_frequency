Who are you? What you really do
When you have to fight the agony that's aiming back at you?
Who are you? Who you run to?
Depend, defend, hope on
Can you function on your own?

Are you from those who will swallow down
The pain, disgrace, the sadness? Yeah
When the one you love so much
Can take your soul and break it, no

First, you said you would die for me
But in the end, I was the one bleeding all alone
First, you said, you kneeled, you swore
You loved, you lived for me
How could you forget it all?

Are you from those who can take a loving heart
And squeeze it out of love?
Then prepare to slowly get not loved but hated instead

You knew that my heart wasn't small
But somehow you came and filled it all
