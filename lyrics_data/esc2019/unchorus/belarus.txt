I guess I forgotten to turn my phone
Off I'm outside my comfort zone
I’m tired of being lonely, tam-tara-ram
Nobody gonna like this, no
Okay, I don't like these empty words
I'll go even if it really hurts
It’s making me stronger, tam-tara-ram
I know it's gonna be

It feels crazy and a little wild
I know what is wrong and what is right
It’s making me wiser, tam-tara-ram
The universe is ours now
Okay, put your favourite sneakers on
And show your emotions on the floor
Add hashtag to find ya, tam-tara-ram
I know it's gonna be

Heya, give me fly, give me fly, give me fly
Heya, like it too, like it too, like it too, baby

I feel the flow of energy
I should let go mistakes of me
I feel the flow of energy, yeah
And you go with me, baby
