Can you hear it?
There's someone behind the wall making the same sounds
Can you hear it?
It sounds like you and me when weâ€™re making love
Who is it?
You said you wish they weren't taking such a long time

Can you feel it?
There's someone sliding up and down the ceiling
Breathing, he is synchronizing with her beating heart
(With her beating heart)

Ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh
Ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh
Ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh
She's only a friend
