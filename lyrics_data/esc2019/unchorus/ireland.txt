I see twenty-two, oh, when I think of you
Lately, that's all I do
Don't you know that I, I'm always driving by
Wanna come home to you

I see twenty-two, oh, it's like déjà vu
Boy, if you only knew
This time I messed it up, but I can't give you up
Your face is all I've got

All alone tonight
Wishing you were laying by my side
So I just keep on driving by
To pass the time

(Every time I'm with somebody I'm confusing him with you) Everybody, no, no, no
(Anywhere I go reminds me of the things we used to do) I remember you
(And I dream about the street where we kissed out of the blue) Number twenty-two
(At your house) Number twenty-two
