Can't you stay, stay with me into the night?
Stay, I need you close
You can go back when the sun rise again
Just stay tonight, just stay

Have you seen my spirit, lost in the night?
The violent nightshade, they took away my light
They call us nothing, my name is nothing
Come see me, please see me

I'll follow you until the daylight
Shy us away

I need a hero, I need my light
Her shining lightwaves will break away the night
I call it freedom, our name is freedom
Come find me, please find me

'Cause I am dancing with the fairies now
They all sing our name
I got my light here, shining here
