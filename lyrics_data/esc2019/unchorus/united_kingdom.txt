Hear these words that I sing to you
I will make it clear, it's me and you
We can have this love that we never lose
It’s bigger than us, mhm

I won’t give up, and I won’t let go
'Cause this kind of love is gonna be our only hope

It's bigger (Bigger)
Bigger (Bigger)
Bigger (It's bigger than, it's bigger than)
Oh, it's bigger (Bigger)
Bigger (Bigger)
Bigger (It's bigger than, it's bigger than)
It's bigger than us
It's bigger than you and me
This kind of love
It's bigger than everything we see, yeah, ooh
So much bigger
Yeah, bigger than us
