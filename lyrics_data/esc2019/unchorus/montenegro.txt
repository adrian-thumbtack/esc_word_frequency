Life, life was once so lonely
Heartbreak was the only thing you left for me
My life, my life was so empty
And love was the furthest, furthest thing from me

There's no place I'd rather be
As the candle glow flees, but with you right here

I got used to feeling naked
Walking blind with hanging heart (With hanging heart)
I was ready to give up
Now you came into my life
