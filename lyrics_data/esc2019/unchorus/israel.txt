Caught up in this moment 'til my heartbeat stops
I've been running barefoot to the mountain tops
Nothing comes as easy as it goes
I can hug the water when it snows

I used to listen to the way they talk
Counting down the minutes from the ticking clock

Home was so far, collecting scars, I refuse
Another touch won't be another bruise

I'm standing tall, not giving in
'Cause I am someone, I am someone
