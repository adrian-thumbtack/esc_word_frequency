Hey you
It's me again
Hey you
Stone in my shoe

I've been aching
Feeling low
You're so heavy
I have got to let you go

Hey you (hey you, hey you, hey you)
Lock with no key
Hey you (hey you, hey you, hey you)
Earth with no sea

I've been freezing
On the ground
You're so heavy
I can't let you keep me down, anymore

Nothing holding me down
Nothing holding me down
Nothing holding me down now
Nothing holding me down
Nothing holding me down
Nothing holding me down
Nothing holding me down now
Nothing holding me down
