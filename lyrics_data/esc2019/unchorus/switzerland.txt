I noticed her when she arrived
Kind of lady that mama like
But mama, she ain't here tonight
Gettin' rowdy, rowdy
When she poured out a little spice
Got the whole place on a vibe
Monday night into Friday night
Gettin' rowdy, rowdy

Oh, she lightin' the fire now
We're goin' wild, like an animal
All in, gonna sweat it out
Gettin' rowdy, rowdy
Turnin' heads and turnin' up
Breakin' necks, she breakin' cups
Look at her, can't get enough
Gettin' rowdy, rowdy

All the boys go, yo yo yo
All the girls go, yo yo yo
Everyone go, yo yo yo
She got us dirty dancin'
