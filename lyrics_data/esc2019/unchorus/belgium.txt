I wake up every night
I can't find anyone to pray
Somewhere in the light
Changing all up
I'm afraid, on the side
Looking out for the lines to say
Someone has the light
Feeding our fire

I'll wait for the sign
I can't find anyone to stay
But there's something in the light
Saving our lives

And I can't face you now
No, I won't break you down
If I can't find you, I won't hide you
It's not what I do
