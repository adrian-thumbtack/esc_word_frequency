You left me on a Sunday
And I still remember that day in September
Yeah, you left me on a Sunday
Made sure thereâ€™s no way, yeah, to forget that day

Watching the smoke rise from the ashtray
Filling the room with pain
It's still in my veins
Can't feel at home, 'cause it's so lonely
So cold and so grey, yeah, since you left that day
You know, you know

Wake me up from this nightmare
Is this even true?
Am I without you?
Love's not fair
Oh, I have learned that
Just never knew that I'll be losing you
You know, you know
