Live for the mess, make me feel ageless
No pain, no gain
Teach me carelessness
And I'm about to see all that's made up
And everything they want from us
No pain, no gain
Once bitten, make way

There's nothing more to say to back it up when I'm unafraid
I've lost enough
Go on, hold on for dear life

Won't you lean on me
You can lean on me
Let them look, don't know, don't care
Go deep with me (Hey)
Go deep with me (Hey)
Go deep with me (Hey)
