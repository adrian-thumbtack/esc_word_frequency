If you wanna see, just open your eyes
If you wanna breathe, let's go outside in the open
Out in the open
But there's no need to stay locked up inside
This kingdom is yours and this kingdom is mine
Let me show you
Just let me show you

If you want a voice, open your mouth
Don't worry about the words, we'll figure it out
Just try it
Just try it

Ooh, ooh, ooh
We got a love that can't be caged
Ooh, ooh, ooh
We got a love that can't be caged
We got a love that can't be caged
Run with the lions, oh-woah-oh-oh
Run with the lions, oh-woah-oh-oh (We got a love that can't be caged)
